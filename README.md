# Master-Seasonality-Business-Trend-Survey
To share the code of my Master Thesis on The Impact of Seasonality on the Statistical Indicators of the Business Trends Survey, case of Lithuania.
In Data folder you could find 4 different excel files with the variables of 4 different sectors.
The main r file ("Main for common functions) includes code that can and should be commonly used for all sectors, also all libraries that were needed.
R codes in accrodance to the sectors are similar, just to make sure that we are not mixed up between the variables, aggregation matrix.
